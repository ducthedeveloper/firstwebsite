# firstwebsite
This is my first web page. It can filter and add stuff to a list. I did it using a tutorial but still very happy that it works! 
 
 I used html, css and JavaScript
 
 Learned more about querySelectors and eventListeners on this project!
 
 Hope you enjoy!
 
 The navbar is not working yet but will be doing that soon.
 
 Let me know if you have things that could be improved, thanks!
